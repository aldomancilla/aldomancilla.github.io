## My Beginnings in Programming 🖥️

I began my journey in web development and software creation over 10 years ago, but my fascination with technology and creativity took root long before then. I've always found it incredible how ideas can transform into interactive digital experiences — how lines of code can evolve into platforms and solutions that genuinely address real-world challenges.

Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working extensively with languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and databases such as MySQL and MongoDB. I've built everything from dynamic websites to comprehensive web applications, striving to create environments that truly meet business needs. My experience with Amazon Cloud services has taught me the importance of delivering scalable and reliable solutions. Writing clean, maintainable code and designing solid architectures are principles I hold dear.

## Creative Background 🧠

What truly sets my journey apart is my rich creative background. Before fully diving into software development, I spent years immersed in visual design and digital art. Tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, and 3D software like Blender have shaped my understanding of user experience and interface design. I believe it's essential to focus not only on functionality but also on how things look, feel, and communicate with users.

## Technical Skills and Creative Blend 👨🏻‍💻 / 🧠

This blend of technical skill and creative insight allows me to connect design and development in meaningful ways. I deeply understand the logic behind systems and the emotions behind experiences. Whether I’m developing a web application, enhancing performance, designing user interfaces, or implementing cloud infrastructure, my ultimate goal is to create solutions that are not only efficient and scalable but also visually engaging.

Even after more than a decade in development, I remain motivated by a sense of curiosity and empathy for the users I serve. I recognize that technology is constantly evolving, and I embrace the opportunity to grow alongside it — learning, experimenting, and striving to improve every day in order to better meet the needs of those around me.


## A Bit More About Me 🚵🏻 🏀 ⛰

I deeply believe that inspiration often comes from the world around us, especially through movement, nature, and the meaningful moments we share. Climbing volcanoes has become a personal passion of mine. There's something truly uplifting about standing above the clouds after a tough hike. It serves as a powerful reminder that growth often requires hard work and determination, a sentiment I think resonates with many of us.

Mountain biking is another activity that brings me joy and excitement. The thrill of navigating trails, maintaining balance, and pushing for precision mirrors the challenges we face when striving to create clean, efficient code. It’s a reminder that focus and effort go hand in hand in our journeys.

Basketball also holds a special place in my heart. I appreciate the intensity of the game, the intricate strategies at play, and the essential teamwork that it fosters. It teaches us valuable lessons in discipline and continuous improvement, which can be so beneficial in all areas of life.

Music and movies are significant parts of my life too. I love how they capture stories, stir emotions, and transport us to different worlds. This mirrors the way well-crafted software and design can engage and connect us. Whether I'm listening to an inspiring soundtrack while working or unwinding with a heartfelt film, I find that creativity in all its forms resonates deeply with me.

Above all, I treasure the moments spent with my family. They are my unwavering support system and provide me with a sense of belonging. I wholeheartedly believe that success is only meaningful when we can share it with the people we care about.

I strive to cultivate balance in my life, combining the precision and creativity of technology, the physical challenges of adventure and sports, and the nurturing of the relationships that truly enrich us. It's all about finding harmony in these aspects of our lives that matter most.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this.
